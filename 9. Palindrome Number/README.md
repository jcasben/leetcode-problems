# 9. Palindrome number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

### Example 1:

Input: `x = 121`

Output: `true`

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2:

Input: `x = -121`

Output: `false`

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-.
Therefore it is not a palindrome.

### Example 3:

Input: `x = 10`

Output: `false`

Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 
### Constraints:

- `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
